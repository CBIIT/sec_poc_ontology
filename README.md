# SEC POC Ontology Work

This repo contains work related to the construction of composite ontology including:

* ICD10CM
* SNOMEDCT
* LOINC
* NCIt

This work uses NCIt and UMLS data sources and mCODE and local crossalk table entries
to create a universal transitive closure and path enumaration tables that allows seamless operations between the ontologies.
